        <p>Learners then review the notes taken by their partner and craft their own
            personal learning goal for the workshop following the three principles
            of:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Your personal learning goal should be positive in
                    nature</strong>. <strong>Goals stated
                    in the positive are much more effective than goals stated in the
                    negative
                    and provide a sound basis for planning future actions.</strong>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>(e.g. “<em>I want to listen more actively to the card members so I can
                really tune
                in to their needs and understand what’s important to them v I’m not
                very good at
                listening to card members and I miss what’s important to them and
                they often
                close the call on me”)</em></p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Your goal should be based on reality and be possible to
                        achieve.</strong></p>
            </li>

            <li>
