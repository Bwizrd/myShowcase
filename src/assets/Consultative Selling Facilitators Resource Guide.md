>   The training is split into twelve facilitated sessions and is supported by a
>   “WebApp” that contains all the material for the learners, together with
>   interactive quizzes, additional and the exercises learners will complete

![](media/ec1d5c43d9c15dfee6a45c73e4dc6f90.png)

>   Ref: Strengths Based Leadership – T Rath & B Conchie – Gallup Press NY 2008

>   Strength Spotting Pairs Activity

>   Ask the learners to find a partner they don’t know as well as others and to
>   sit together to discuss the following questions:

1.  What do I most enjoy in my day to day activities at TLS?

2.  What part of my current role energises me?

3.  What were my greatest accomplishments in the past 6 months?

>   The partner asks the questions of their colleague, makes a note what they
>   say and then they swap over.

>   **Personal Learning Goal**

>   Learners then review the notes taken by their partner and craft their own
>   personal learning goal for the workshop following the three principles of:

-   **Your personal learning goal should be positive in nature**. **Goals stated
    in the positive are much more effective than goals stated in the negative
    and provide a sound basis for planning future actions.**

(e.g. “*I want to listen more actively to the card members so I can really tune
in to their needs and understand what’s important to them v I’m not very good at
listening to card members and I miss what’s important to them and they often
close the call on me”)*

-   **Your goal should be based on reality and be possible to achieve.**

-   **You intend to support your goal through energy and effort.**

>   Ask the learners to share their personal learning goal with their partners.

>   Facilitator to check in with learners during this activity to ensure their
>   personal learning goal meets the above principles.

>   Facilitator to sign post session 2.

| 9.45am 10.00am 10.10am 10.23am 10.30am | **Developing New Habits**  **State** - if we want to achieve our personal learning goals then we will need to build some new habits to keep us on track. Here’s a useful image that shows how this works and where we need to focus all of our energy and effort to be super successful. **Show the Iceberg Model:** | 1 2 3 5 6  | Facilitator Resources - Ref “Hay Iceberg Model” **"***Make the unconscious conscious*," Carl Jung Be -Do-Win cycle (animated cycle) Handout and in App Handout and in App Handout and in App Handout and in App Handout and in App Brain and Neuroplasticity video and in App (WDR video collection) Trainer resources: |

Explain how the results we achieve start way down under the waterline with our
*beliefs and values* which drive our thinking and emotions which lead to the
above the waterline and the *habits and behaviours* we show to the world.

Let’s try this theory out - If you **don’t** believe you can work on your
listening skills and don’t value the importance of practising your new skills,
then your thinking and emotions will be “can’t do” and as a result you won’t
have the motivation to create the new habits and demonstrate the behaviours
needed to get the results.

If we want to make changes to how we do things, then we need to work under the
waterline first!

Here’s a phrase that we’ll be referring to during the next two days:

**Be – Do – Win**

**The Be stands for Being**

This is us - a human being and it’s everything about us that’s under the
waterline – starting with our BELIEFS

**The Do stands for Doing**

This is what people see us doing – what we are saying, how we are acting, our
behaviours, our skills and how we show up and DO our job

**The Win stands for Winning** (or Losing**)**

This is all about the results – what we achieve through our Being and our Doing
– do we WIN or do we Lose?

Take a moment now to think about your personal learning goal. Answer the
following three questions and make a note of your answers:

-   **What do I need to believe to achieve my goal?**

-   **What do I need to do to achieve my goal?**

-   **What will I see, hear, feel happening, differently for me when I achieve
    my goal?**

**The Power of Beliefs**

**Ask –** what is a belief?

Look for:

-   Something you don’t question – it’s just there

-   Presented as generalisations

-   Rules that people judge their experiences by

-   People act as if they are true – without examining them

-   Have a major impact (+/-) on behaviour

State, beliefs are all of the above and:

-   **Have a major impact on your doing**

-   **Beliefs drive your thinking**

-   **Set the ceiling on what you can achieve**

-   **Beliefs are not fixed and unchangeable**

-   **Changing beliefs will have a quicker impact on behaviour than the other
    way around**

-   **You can choose which beliefs you want**

-   **You can change your own beliefs**

Limiting Beliefs to Empowering Beliefs

State - here are some examples of beliefs we all might have. State - please get
into pairs and identify which ones are Limiting beliefs and which ones are
Empowering beliefs.

-   “Some card members just don’t want to do business with us” (L)

-   “I made a mistake on the system and I can learn from it” (E)

-   “Success means getting rejected more often” (E)

-   “I made a mistake on the system – why am I so stupid” (L)

-   “Life’s great when we are busy – more opportunities to promote TLS” (E)

-   “We’re so busy today – I just need to get through the calls” (L)

-   “Getting rejected by a card member means I’ve failed” (L)

Plenary de-brief

Ask - What can you do if a limiting belief pops into your head?

Look for:

-   Challenge it – where’s the actual evidence for this?

-   Get some coaching and support from your team leader/team coach/colleague

-   Replace it with an empowering belief – and notice the shift in your
    thinking, your emotions, your behaviours and your results you get

**Neuroscience – how the brain works in creating new habits**

State – finally, we want to make these new thoughts and actions stick and keep
us in a positive and empowering state when we are talking to our card members.

We can actually “train our brain” to create new neural pathways. Watch this
short video which shows how this happens.

Show the video.

State - the brain is such a magnificent thing. You can build the brain you want.

The more we practice and put energy and positive intent into our new and
empowering beliefs and thoughts, the stronger these neural pathway routes become
in our brains.

Practice makes permanent!

We will return to this topic at the end of day with the 21 Day New Habit
Challenge.

**Teach to Learn – pairs activity**

Review your handouts and the notes you have taken and the content within the
App.

Stand up and find a partner and share three insights from the session and answer
any questions they may have. Swap over and then move on to find a new partner
and once again teach in your three insights.

1.  **Greet – this is about making a powerful connection with the card member**

2.  **Build Value – this is about building a high trust relationship with the
    card member and understanding what’s important to them**

3.  **Close – this is about gaining the customer’s commitment to the solution we
    present and building their confidence in TLS**

State – this is an *introduction* to the sales process that TLS is adopting – we
will look at each of the three stages in more detail during today and tomorrow.

**Uncovering the Beliefs, Practices and Results for each stage of the sales
process**

Trainer to split the group into three smaller groups.

Explain that each group will move around the three flip charts to discuss each
of the three stages of the sales process and identify the Be – Do – Win for each
of them.

Trainer states that this is timed activity and each group will have 15 mins at
each of the 3 stages before a whistle sounds and they move on to the next flip.

-   Group 1 start at Greet

-   Group 2 start at Builds Value

-   Group 3 start at Close

**Round 1** – the groups discuss the *first section only* on their flip chart –
**Being**, and discuss the beliefs/attitude/mindset (the below the waterline
areas) that the TLS consultant would need to adopt at this stage of the
conversation with the customer.

After 12 mins the trainer blows the whistle and the groups move onto the next
flip chart – Group 1 moves to Builds Value, Group 2 moves to Close and Group 3
moves to Greet.

**Round 2** - the groups review what their colleagues have entered on the flips
and add in anything extra before moving on to discuss the **Doing,** and
identify the actions and activities, skills and behaviours ( the above the
waterline areas) that a TLS consultant would demonstrate for that stage of the
sales process.

After 12 mins the trainer blows the whistle and the groups move onto their final
flip chart.

**Round 3** – the groups review what their colleagues have entered on the flips
and add in anything extra before moving on to discussing the Winning and
identify what achieving a winning result looks like/sounds like/feels like from
the *card holder* and *TLS consultant’s* perspective for that stage of the sales
process.

After 12 mins the trainer blows the whistle and the groups move back to their
original starting point and review the completed flip chart and add in any final
points.

**Round 4 –** the groups then review each of the completed flip charts “art
gallery style” and take pictures of each of the flip charts on their mobile
phones to upload onto their App.

Plenary debrief session

Ask – What have you discovered during this activity?

Look for – beliefs need to be empowering at each of the 3 stages/different
actions and activities needed at the different stages/some behaviours are used
constantly throughout – e.g. being present, communicating/listening/being clear
on the win (from both perspectives) is super important and it would be good have
this in mind from the outset.

Trainer to state that the phrase “Begin with the end in Mind” – links to the Win
of Be Do Win. When you are clear on what a winning result looks like/sounds
like/feels like – you are setting the course for success.

Trainer to highlight that Be- Do -Win is a powerful tool to adopt at each stage
of the conversation with the customer.

It gives you a blueprint for personal success.

**Teach to Learn – Pairs Activity**

Review your learning for the session. Stand up and find a partner and share
three insights from the session and answer any questions they may have. Swap
over and then move on to find a new partner and once again teach in your three
insights.

Trainer to signpost to the next session.

State – one of the key activities uncovered in this session was Communication.
The next session will explore this topic and you will discover more about the
way you personally communicate and how you can flex and adapt your style to make
powerful connections with the card holders.

| 12.00pm 12.05pm 12.10pm 12.20pm 12.30pm 12.35pm 12.40pm 12.50pm | **Model of Effective Communication** Trainer states – there are many models of human communication – the one we will be using explains how each of us perceives the world based upon our own beliefs, attitudes, values and our past experiences. Essentially, we never see the world as it really is, but only through our own unconscious filters which act to distort, generalise and delete information resulting in a highly subjective and unique world view that we share with nobody else. The challenge with these unconscious filters is that they may well prevent the message that we are communicating to another person from being received and understood in the way that we intend. To help you understand the communication model, I am going to play a short video for you. As you watch the video please make a note in your handouts/on the app of the key points covered as we will be doing an exercise afterwards. | 1 2 3      | General slide to show the word “communication” along with some models – abstract style. High impact video which explains the key areas of the Communication Model Model on app Slide of Communication Model “Fred the Head” |

-   External Event (information)

-   Filters

-   Internal Representation

-   Physiology

-   Behaviour

-   Results

Play video of Fred The Head.

Ensure learners are taking notes on a handout or within the App.

Show slide – of “Fred the Head”

Split group into pairs/ trios and ask then to discuss for 3 minutes their
learning about *one* of the key areas covered in the video and present back
three points for their designated topic area:

-   External Event (information)

-   Filters

-   Internal Representation

-   Physiology

-   Behaviour

-   Results

Each pair/trio shares their topic area learning points with the group.

Trainer captures their points on a flip chart and positions the flip chart at
the front of the room.

**Positive impacts**

Trainer states –

this slide illustrates where we can have the highest impact when talking to Card
Members.

This is about how we positively affect their own internal representations,
enabling them to feel good and positive about us at all TLS and the travel
solution you will be presenting to them.

How can we quickly have a positive impact on a card members’ internal
representations to create a powerful connection?

Use example of positive metaphors and negative metaphors. Example “…Better than
a poke in the eye with a sharp stick” does not create positive internal
representations! However, an example like “The icing on the cake” creates
positive internal representations for people.

Get group to give positive examples and enter on the flipchart.

**Representational Systems**

Show video

Trainer states –

As you saw in the video and discussed in the learning exercise afterwards, the
senses through which we experience the world are referred to as
**representational systems**.

Have learners use the app to answer the “Representational Systems Preference
Quiz” to determine their own preferred system.

Show predicates words and phrases and explain how these words illustrate how
someone is creating their own internal representations.

Give examples:

-   Smells fishy to me

-   He reeks of infidelity

-   I can see what you mean

-   That rings a bell

-   That experience leaves a bad taste in my mouth

-   I can’t get a handle on that

-   That makes sense to me

**Exercise in pairs:**

Take a holiday/travel package and describe it to your partner in your least
preferred rep system (the system you scored the lowest score on in the app).
Partner listens. Then swap. Three minutes each, the quick group feedback

**Teach to Learn – pairs activity**

“A” and “B”

“A” explains the basic Communication Model and the function of filters (talk
about beliefs and how they shape our perception of reality)

Then swap

“B” explains representational systems to “A”

| 1400       | **Greet: Powerful First Impressions** Trainer says: “Creating a powerful impression when you first speak to a Card Member who is calling for travel advice is crucial to you building an effective and productive relationship with that Card member. You will need access to your CRM data about the Card Member so that you are fully informed about previous history, travel preferences, personal situation, etc. This information, together with a powerful opening to the call will enable you to create a strong connection with the Card Member and to rapidly build rapport and trust. Before we discuss exactly how you will do this, let’s watch this short video on first impressions.” Play video: Session 5 Intro Trainer says: “You know from Session 4 on the Communication Model that your internal representations, beliefs, self-talk and physiology affect your internal state. And having a positive internal representation about the Card Member and the outcome of the call is crucial to your success. Refer back to the work on beliefs you did in Session 2 and identify those positive beliefs that will empower you and support you in creating a successful outcome from the call.” You need to hold these empowering and positive beliefs in your mind as you take calls with your Card Members. Simply holding these beliefs to be true will change the way you interact with your Card Members.” |            | Access CRM Data – example on PowerPoint Play video: Session 5 Intro Video Learner refer back to the positive, empowering beliefs. Share them with Group and trainer lists some on flipchart |
| 1415       | **Practising your greeting** Trainer says: “You know from the video that people can make up their mind about someone within the first 100 milliseconds of meeting someone. This is 1/10th of a second! Given this data, you have to work hard to build rapport and trust as early as you can, and your opening greeting is your first step in the process.

-   Card Member scenario activities – trios (1 observer to feedback)

-   One is the Consultant; One is the Card Member and one is the observer

-   Card Member and Consultant sit back-to-back so they cannot see each other
    but can hear each other

-   Consultant takes a minute to remember empowering beliefs, create positive
    internal representations and a physiology of excellence.

-   Consultant opens the call with a question: “Good morning/afternoon/evening,
    how can I help you?

-   CM responds as naturally as they can explaining they want to go on a
    vacation

-   Consultant listens for any predicates or phrases. Make a mental note. If
    detected, follow up in appropriate rep system (AD if none detected)

-   Continue conversation, Consultant asks the CM why they are going on the
    trip, what is important to them about the trip and the kind of experience
    they are looking for

-   Note rep systems and respond appropriately

-   Observer observes and takes notes

-   Five minutes each and then swap around so everyone gets to be the
    Consultant, CM and observer

-   Trainer collects feedback at the end and answers any questions

-   Learners work in pairs “A” and “B”

-   “A” shares with “B” their three most important takeaways from the session
    and how they will use this in the future

-   Then swap and repeat
